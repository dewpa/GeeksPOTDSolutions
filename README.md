# GeeksPOTDSolutions
Welcome to the GeeksPOTDSolutions repository! This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to the daily "Problem of the Day" (POTD) challenges from GeeksforGeeks (GFG).

About
GeeksforGeeks (GFG) is a renowned platform for computer science enthusiasts, offering a plethora of problems to hone coding skills. The "Problem of the Day" (POTD) is a daily challenge that tests various aspects of problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms.

This repository aims to:

Provide well-documented solutions to each daily POTD.
Help programmers understand different approaches to solving the problems.
Serve as a learning resource for those preparing for coding interviews and competitive programming.
Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

DailySolutions/: Contains folders for each month, with subfolders for each day. Each daily folder includes the problem statement and solution code.
