## Title : Binary representation of next number

### Problem Description

Given a binary representation in the form of a string(s) of a number n, the task is to find a binary representation of n+1.

Note: Output binary string should not contain leading zeros.

### Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function binaryNextNumber()which takes s as input parameter and returns the string.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

Expected Time Complexity: O(n) \
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

### Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^5

**Examples**

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "10"
Output: 11
Explanation: "10" is the binary representation of 2 and binary representation of 3 is "11"

```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "111"
Output: 1000
Explanation: "111" is the binary representation of 7 and binary representation of 8 is "1000"

```
